SQL Class View 9th Jan 2004.
View have 1 objective, view shows the data of a table to a dummy table,
Like a user can see only specific fields of a table not the whole table
then view is used, which shows the selected fields to the user.

Like the Sales person should see only empname and address then we will
create a view for the sales persons which will only show ename and address
to the sales persons.

If there are more then 100 SQL users having different Rights then

Now we are creating view for sales persons,
-------------------------------------------
Syntax:
Create view viewName
	as {SQL Command}

Code:
Create view for_salesEmp
	as select ename,job,hiredate 
	from emp;

Now as the view is created then how to see this by the folowing code

select * from for_salesEmp;

View does not have any data of its own, when it is called then it gets
the data from that table and shows the data. If we update and delete
then the master table will be updated.

For Example updating data;
--------------------------
Update for_salesEmp
	Set job='ANALYST'
	where ename='ADAMS';

You can only update the columns which are in the view like both the 
fields shold be present in the view like above 2 fields are present in
view, but it we write the same as this

Update for_salesEmp
	Set job='ANALYST'
	where Sal=4000;
This will not work because sal field is not present in the view.

For Insert and Delete in the view might create a problem like in insert
If there is a field which is not null and that field is not present in
view then it will make a problem, like if empno is primary key then
if we are inserting record from view there is not empno present then...

So that we are creating a view for sales department which will show
only the salesman data for salesman, and they can update delete and 
insert salesman data only view code is

Create view salesView
	as select *
	from emp where job='SALESMAN'

Create view Dept20View
	as select *
    	from emp where Deptno=20

by this way we can insert and delete records from this view because
all fields are present in this view.... now we insert record

insert into Dept20View (empno,ename,deptno)
	values(1256,'ADEEL',10);

Our view shows the data of Dept no 20 but we inserted data of dept10
data, so keep this in ur mind, What ever the inserting is they will
not be able to see the data which is not of Deptno20 thats all abt view

Now to delete a view
--------------------
Syntax:
Drop View ViewName;

Code:
drop view Dept20View;
=====================




-----------------------------------------
Grant select,update to all;
will let everyone read and delete records.
