Scott tiger is just a user and system is the dba

Login as dba using the following command as dba

connect system/manager;

To create a new user we login as dba, system/manager and create users, and change password 

To Change password.
Alter user system identified by newPassword;
------------------------------------------------------
To create a new user login as system and use the folowing syntax

Syntax
Create user username identified by password;

code
create user Adeel identified by malik;

To make this user able to login grant connect permission then you will be able to login SQL.

Syntax
Grant connect to UserName;

Code
Grant connect to adeel;

Now u will not be able to create any tables for that also u need a privilage to create tables.

To see tables of scott user, connect scott and give permission to your user to see scott's employee table which will be read only. see code

Grant select on emp to adeel; 
this will beRead only

Grant select,update,delete on emp to adeel;
Also u can give this.

Now login ur user and use the following syntax to see the scott user's emp table

select * from scott.emp;

By ur user you can insert update and delete records only you can not drop scott's table from ur user. Only scott or system user can delete.

Now to grant user to create tables in his user

Grant resource to Adeel;

The following user will be make a user dba
grant dba to adeel;

Writig all the permission together
Grant connect,select,resource to adeel
------------------------------------------------------

After dab you are everything;

Changing table's Structure is called Alter see example

Syntax
Alter table TableName
	Add(ColumnName Type);
Code
Alter table member
	Add(Email varchar(30));
This will add Email column in table member

-------------------------------------------------------
Now if you want to set this column as not null then you will not be able to do that because there is no value at this time in the column so use a dummy value to be inserted in the column's records 

update member set email=abc;
This will add values abc to every record in column email now make it not null

Alter table member
	modify(email varchar(30) not null);

To change existing column's structure by using modify.
To change data type if the column is null then you can do that without any problem otherwise there will be a problem. If you want to increse the column's size then ther will be no problem but in decrease the size, you can only do that if the column is null.

Alter table member
	modify(email varchar(10) not null);
