Sub Querries
============

Query 1) select * from emp where ename='JONES';
Query 2) select * from emp where sal>2975;

If we combine the above Querry we get a sub Query, it means Query inside a Query
See below 2 in 1

Select * from emp where sal>(select sal from emp where ename='JONES');

closely analyse the above querry we are using sal outside as well as inside sal also this is a rule.
That you will select the same columns see some more examples;
-------------------------------------------------------------

The next Querry shows the same Designation as SMITH

	select * from emp where job=(select job from emp where ename='SMITH');

List that employee who are getting highest salary in dept no 20

	select max(sal) from emp where deptno=20;

Now show who gets more salary then the above Querry's result see below
	
	select * from emp where sal>(select max(sal) from emp where deptno=20);

Show those employees who get more salary then any employee then dept no 30

	select * from emp where sal>(select min(sal) from emp where deptno=30);

or we can write the same Querry as follow see below
	
	select * from emp where sal>any (select sal from emp where deptno=30);
	any is used for Min (minimum value)

for Max we use all see below
	
	select * from emp where sal>all (select sal from emp where deptno=30);

Show those employees who earn less then the avg salary then managers
	
	select * from emp where sal<(select avg(sal) from emp where job='MANAGER');

Show those employees who are getting more salary then the avg salary of managers

	select * from emp where job='MANAGER' and sal>(select avg(sal) from emp where job='MANAGER');
	or
	select * from emp where sal>(select avg(sal) from emp where job='MANAGER') and job='MANAGER';

List employees in dept no 10 with same job as anyone as martin
	
	select * from emp where deptno=10 and job=(select * from emp where ename='SMITH');

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List employees as the same job and sale sal as ford

	select * from emp where
	sal=(select sal from emp where ename='FORD')
	and job=(select job from emp where ename='FORD');

	or

	select * from emp where (job,sal)=(select job,sal from emp where ename='SMITH');
